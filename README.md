# ETH-AVX-PROJECT-1
 ETH-AVX-PROJECT-1_Module 1
 
This the project of the course ETH-AVX moule1.

In this project we have created a smart contract name meta_project, which show case the use of the error handling in Solidity.

function used are:

require()-- require is a fundamental function used for enforcing conditions within your smart contracts. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring specific requirements are met before proceeding with code execution.

revert()-- revert is a function used to revert a transaction and undo all state changes made within the current function call.

assert()--assert is used for internal error handling and to check invariants within your smart contract.
